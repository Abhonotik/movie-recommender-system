Movie Recommender System
This project is a content-based movie recommender system built using Python and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Pickle. The system suggests similar movies based on a given movie's characteristics such as genre, keywords, and description.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy: Numerical operations

Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms for model training and evaluation

Pickle: Serialization and saving models

Jupyter Notebook: For exploratory data analysis and model development

Features
Content-based Recommendation: Recommends 5 movies similar to the one selected.

Movie Dataset: The system uses a movie dataset containing information such as genre, description, and keywords.

Model Training: The system trains a machine learning model to identify similarities between movies.

Movie Similarity: Based on the cosine similarity between movies using TF-IDF vectorization.

Pickle File: Trained model is saved and can be reused without retraining
